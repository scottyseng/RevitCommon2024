# RevitCommon
An example of a simple library to instantiate buttons to Revit's ribbon UI and get the document scale from a file.

These started off as simple examples of how to use an common library (and was previously named RevitLibExample) for Revit to help expand interoperability.  Now contains common functions for instantiating buttons in the Revit ribbon UI and excel interoperability.

This project is an attempt at updating this to work with the Revit 2024 API
